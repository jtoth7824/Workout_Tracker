# Workout Tracker

The Workout Tracker is an application to allow a user to track their workout and exercise history.  A user can add exercises to an existing workout by hitting the continue button.  Alternatively, the user can create a new workout and add exercises to that workout.  The home page displays information about the last workout's exercises.  There is also a Dashboard link on home page that displays the statistics about the last 7 workouts.    There are 4 charts displayed.   The first is a line chart showing the total duration of exercises per workout.  The second chart is a bar chart showing the total amout of weight lifted per workout.  The third chart is a pie chart that reflects the total duration per exercise over the last 7 workouts.  These exercises have been de-duplicated.   The last chart is a donut chart that reflects the total weight lifted per exercise over the last 7 workouts.  These exercises have also been de-duplicated across workouts.

This application utilizes a no-sql database on the back end through the use of mongoose.  The total number of workouts returned from database is limited to the last 7.  The total durations per workout were aggregated on the back end with use of aggregate and addFields to publish the total durations to the front end.  In addition, the application has been deployed to Heroku.
